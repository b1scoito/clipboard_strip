# Clipboard Strip

Clipboard Strip is an application to manage your data, formating to paste in order.
  - Copy your information with the format ```data1|data2|data3|data4```
  - Press Ctrl+V at it will paste ```data1``` and once it's pressed again ```data2``` and so on, making application logins way less tedious!
